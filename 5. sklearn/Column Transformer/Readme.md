# Column Transformer
ColumnTransformer is a transformer provided by scikit-learn that allows you to apply different transformers to different columns of a dataset. It is often used to preprocess data in a machine learning pipeline by applying different transformations to different types of features.

For example, suppose you have a dataset with both numerical and categorical features, and you want to scale the numerical features and one-hot encode the categorical features. You can use a ColumnTransformer to apply these transformations separately to the different types of features.
